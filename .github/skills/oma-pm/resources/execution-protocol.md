# PM Agent - Execution Protocol

## Step 0: Prepare
1. **Assess difficulty**: see `../../_shared/core/difficulty-guide.md`
   - **Simple**: Lightweight plan, 3-5 tasks | **Medium**: Full 4 steps | **Complex**: Full + API contracts
2. **Clarify requirements**: follow `../../_shared/core/clarification-protocol.md` (critical for PM)
   - Check **Uncertainty Triggers**: business logic, security/auth, existing code conflicts?
   - Determine level: LOW → proceed | MEDIUM → present options | HIGH → ask immediately
3. **Check lessons**: read cross-domain section in `../../_shared/core/lessons-learned.md`
4. **If governance, risk, or formal planning matters**: read `resources/iso-planning.md`

**Intelligent Escalation**: When uncertain, escalate early. Don't blindly proceed.

Follow these steps in order (adjust depth by difficulty).

## Step 1: Analyze Requirements
- Parse user request into concrete requirements
- Identify explicit and implicit features
- List edge cases and assumptions
- Ask clarifying questions if ambiguous
- Use Serena (if existing codebase): `get_symbols_overview` to understand current architecture
- If risk or governance matters, identify:
  - stakeholders
  - constraints
  - decision owners
  - major delivery risks

## Step 2: Design Architecture
- Select tech stack (frontend, backend, mobile, database, infra)
- Define API contracts (method, path, request/response schema)
- Design data models (tables, relationships, indexes)
- Identify security requirements (auth, validation, encryption)
- Plan infrastructure (hosting, caching, CDN, monitoring)
- When relevant:
  - map plan structure to ISO 21500-style project management concepts
  - record top risks and treatments using ISO 31000-style thinking
  - note governance, responsibility, and approval needs using ISO 38500-style thinking

## Step 3: Decompose Tasks
- Break into tasks completable by a single agent
- Each task has: agent, title, description, acceptance criteria, priority, dependencies, **scope**
- `agent`: one of the orchestrator-dispatchable domains — `backend`, `frontend`, `mobile`, `db`, `qa`, `debug`, `pm`, `architecture`, `refactor`, `tf-infra`, `docs` (see the agent mapping table in `.agents/workflows/orchestrate.md`)
- `scope`: array of directory prefixes this agent is allowed to modify (e.g., `["src/api/", "migrations/"]`). Used by `verify` to detect cross-agent boundary violations in parallel execution.
- **Test approach (opt-in, per task)**: set `test_approach` where a test strategy matters
  - `tdd`: deterministic, high-risk behavior (validation, authorization, state transitions, calculations, error handling). Implementation agent must record RED→GREEN evidence (see `TDD_EVIDENCE` block below).
  - `test_after`: automated tests required, but a useful isolated RED state is impractical
  - `not_applicable`: automated tests inappropriate — **must** fill `test_approach_rationale` and `alternative_verification` (documented manual/alternative check)
  - Do **not** mark `tdd` for: documentation, pure styling, generated code, IaC plans, behavior-preserving refactors (refactor tasks keep their characterization-test safety net), or inherently nondeterministic integrations
  - `test_scope`: which layers the tests cover (e.g., `["unit", "integration"]`)
  - No `test_approach` value ever waives the global unit-test coverage gate (>= 80%); `not_applicable` code still counts toward the aggregate unless declaratively excluded in coverage config with justification
- Minimize dependencies for maximum parallel execution
- Priority tiers: 1 = independent (run first), 2 = depends on tier 1, etc.
  - The numeric tier is the **canonical** `priority` value in plan JSON (what the orchestrator fans out on).
  - Human-readable trackers (`docs/plans/work/{NNN}-{name}.md`) use the same numeric tier in their Priority column. Do not use a separate P0/P1-style scale.
- Complexity: Low / Medium / High / Very High
- Save to `.agents/results/plan-{sessionId}.json` and `.agents/results/result-pm.md`
- `{sessionId}` = `{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS}` at plan creation, matching the orchestrator session convention (`oma-orchestrator/resources/memory-schema.md`); also record it in the plan JSON `session_id` field

## Step 4: Validate Plan
- Check: Can each task be done independently given its dependencies?
- Check: Are acceptance criteria measurable and testable?
- Check: Is `test_approach` valid where set (`tdd|test_after|not_applicable`), with rationale + alternative verification for every `not_applicable`? (`oma verify pm` enforces this contract)
- Check: Is security considered from the start (not deferred)?
- Check: Are API contracts defined before frontend/mobile tasks?
- Check: Are major risks, owners, and approval points explicit when needed?
- Output task-board.md format for orchestrator compatibility
